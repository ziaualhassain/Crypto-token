Cryto token Creation
To create a token we need not to write a whole code from scratch
We can use a already existing file ERC-21 it is a file you can find on openzepllin github repository
Simple you can copy the .sol file and run it in the remix IDE.
In the deployment you can give the name of the token
Make sure you are in a testnet and deploy the file "Web3 injected".
Import the token address in the metamask and boom you can see the token in your wallet
